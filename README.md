# CIS Cri-o Benchmark

## Overview

The CIS Cri-o Benchmark is a set of security recommendations and best practices designed to enhance the security posture of container runtimes that use Cri-o, a lightweight container runtime specifically built for Kubernetes. Developed by the Center for Internet Security (CIS), this benchmark provides guidance on securing the Cri-o runtime environment to mitigate potential vulnerabilities and threats.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the CIS Cri-o Benchmark is to establish a security baseline for organizations utilizing Cri-o in their containerized environments. By adhering to the recommended security configurations outlined in this benchmark, users can reduce the risk of security incidents, unauthorized access, and potential exploits within Cri-o-based container runtimes.

## Key Features

- **Automated Assessments:** The benchmark includes automated checks and tests to evaluate the security of Cri-o configurations, making it easier for users to identify and address security gaps.
- **Manual Recommendations:** In addition to automated checks, the benchmark provides manual recommendations that guide users in configuring security settings that may require human intervention.
- **Scoring System:** Each recommendation is scored to help users prioritize and focus on critical security measures. The scoring system aids in assessing the overall security posture of the Cri-o runtime environment.

## Contents

The CIS Cri-o Benchmark covers a wide range of security-related topics, including:

- Network Configuration
- Process Controls
- Filesystem Protections
- Container Runtime Settings
- Host Configuration
- Docker Security Operations
- Docker Swarm Configuration

## Usage

Users can leverage the CIS Cri-o Benchmark to:

- Assess the security configuration of Cri-o-based container runtimes.
- Implement security best practices to protect containerized workloads.
- Continuously monitor and update Cri-o configurations in response to emerging security threats.
