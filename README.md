Original Readme (2020):
We are a group of 4 students from the Netherlands currently in our last year for our Bachelor in Computer Sciences. 
For our project we are assigned a research in building a Cri-O runtime benchmark which is based on the AquaSecurity Docker-Benchmark. 
This project is carried out in cooperation with company which specialises in  software development and IT-architecture. 

We've developed a Cri-O config 1.0 for the Aquasecurity Benchmark. 
The definitions of the Docker-Benchmark have been evaluated and assesed for applicability on a Cri-O runtime environment.
In order to run the Benchmark, run the Aquasecurity benchmark with the following argumet: --benchmark crio-1.0
!Note!: if you have customised your Cri-O container storage location, please change the value of "crio-storage" in config.yaml

For now the company name will be undisclosed until further notice.
